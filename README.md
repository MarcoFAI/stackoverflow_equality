# Equality In Education And Work Analysis

## Installations
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 
No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in analysing the equality in education and work using the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) containing approximately 83500 responses from developers. The questions I tried to better understand using the data were:
 - Do people with physical disabilities have disadvantages in education and work?
 - Do people with mental health issues have disadvantages in education and work?
 - Do not heterosexual people have disadvantages in education and work?
 - Do trans people have disadvantages in education and work?

I have summarized my findings in a [Blog Post on Medium](https://medium.com/@marco.schlinger/853f4c7e3566) that should give a better insight into the questions and findings. 

## File Descriptions
A script is available for each of the four questions. Comments in it explain the procedure in more detail.
There is also a script available to take a first look at the data.

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the [Medium Blog post](https://medium.com/@marco.schlinger/853f4c7e3566)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
Acknowledgement should go to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for providing the dataset.
